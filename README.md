## Getting Started
1. Compliling (Logic Synthesis)  
HDL->Circuits
2. Simulation  
Circuit match/mismatch (ref)  
Waveform match/mismatch (timing diagram, ref)

## Verilog Basics
1. Wire: directional, continuous assignment. Assignment creates connections between wires. Wires are declared at the input/output
